# Genetic algorithm finding a phrase
An implementation in rust, of the same algorithm I made in https://github.com/zethika/genetic-algorithm-phrase.  
This was my first time ever working with rust, so this repo was both to get some actual experience with it, but also to judge how it's performance stacked up as a wasm module, compared to regular JS.  
The performance results and my improvement iterations on it is described more in [this](https://github.com/zethika/genetic-algorithm-phrase-rust-performance) repo.
